# A daily dozen food planner

Herbivorous is a daily food journal based on the [Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/), a science-based set of nutritious food recommendations for a plant-based diet. We aim to make planning a healthy vegan diet a little easier and give you the tools you need to treat yourself and other beings on this planet with the utmost love and care. â™¥

Please consult a medical professional about the right diet for you. You can browse more information on plant-based nutrition at [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org), or check out [How Not to Die](https://literal.club/book/how-not-to-die-60zr1) for further reading on the benefits of whole plant foods and the scientific body of research supporting these guidelines.
